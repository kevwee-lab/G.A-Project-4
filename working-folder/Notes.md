Objectives:
1. Predict WNV for test dataset, submit to kaggle
    - time series model?
2. CBA for pesticide spray
    - effectiveness of pesticide spray (analyse based on data)


- no need use all the data

- time series model to predict WNV
    - take into account spray & weather


time series for each trap?
    - wait for more lessons, see if got better way to model instead of individual model for each trap

classification model with some temporal features


choropleth


EDA:
explore data
    - other 2 datasets (spray & weather) in relation to targets (wnv, no of mosquitos)
    - individual prelim EDAs by wed (31/3)
