    "1) spraying is usually conducted around 8pm till 1 am using trucks with low volume sprays, and the EPA approved spray is Zenivex. <br>\n",
    "2) the spray rate is [1.5 ounces per acre](https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/city-to-spray-mosquito-killing-insecticide-wednesday-night/64951/). <br>\n",
    "3) the cost per gallon (128 ounces) of Zenivex is [approximately \\$ 300 USD.](http://www.gfmosquito.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-ND-Mosq.-Control-Quotes-Tabulation.pdf) <br>\n",
    "4) the city of chicago is approximately 145,300 acres in [total area](https://www.themeasureofthings.com/results.php?comp=area&unit=a&amt=160000&p=1). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in order to achieve \"maximum\" benefit, let's assume that the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) adopts an aggressive approach towards culling the virus, and decides to conduct spraying on the whole of Chicago."
